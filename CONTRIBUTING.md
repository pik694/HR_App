# Contributing to HR App

This file specifies rules we must stick to. Each contributor is obliged to read this file and comply with the following rules. 

## Contributor Workflow

1. Create issue
1. Create topic branch from development
1. Commit changes
1. Pull changes to development branch
1. Create pull request to testing
1. Pull changes to testing
1. Create pull request to master
1. Pull to master

## Issues

Please create an issue when either some features need to be introduced or changes are needed. 

### Title
Should not be long, but as descriptive as possible. Use keywords so it is easy to search through issues to find the one.

### Description / Comment
Creating an issue please specify the problem or what is needed to done in the comment. 
*Isses without the comment will be dismissed.*

### Others
1. If it is possible assing a person or persons.
1. Tag issue with labels.
1. If issue is releveant to the current sprint choose the proper milestone choose the project.

## Branches

For each issue a topic branch should be created. 



### Branch naming conventions

Use grouping tokens (words) at the beginning of your branch names.
Define and use short lead tokens to differentiate branches in a way that is meaningful to your workflow.
Use slashes to separate parts of your branch names.
Do not use bare numbers as leading parts.
Avoid long descriptive names for long-lived branches.

Branches' names should conform to the following pattern:
```
<grouping_token>/<issue_no>/<additional_description>
```
* `grouping_token` - `devel`, `testing`, `hotfix`
* `issue_no` - number of an issue 
* `additional_description` - description of an issue, not to long
Example
```
devel/1/new_view
```
```
hotfix/2/keyboard_problem
```
### Workflow

## Pull requests

We use pull requests either to move changes (`development` -> `testing`  -> `master`) or when a hotfix is introduced and needs to be pulled into `master`/`testing`.
<br />
Pull requests should have a comment decsribing what does it chagne and why it is needed.
<br />
We move changes from `developement` after each stage of development is finished. 

## Commit Message Guidelines
```
Short (72 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text. Wrap it to 72 characters. The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely).

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too.
- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space. Use a hanging indent.
```

### Example for a commit message
```
Add CPU arch filter scheduler support

In a mixed environment of…
```

### A properly formed git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence
If applied, this commit will *\<your subject line here\>*

### Rules for a great git commit message style
* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap lines at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why you have done something. In most cases, you can leave out details about how a change has been made.

### Information in commit messages
* Describe why a change is being made.
* How does it address the issue?
* What effects does the patch have?
* Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was.
* Do not assume the code is self-evident/self-documenting.
* Read the commit message to see if it hints at improved code structure.
* The first commit line is the most important.
* Describe any limitations of the current code.
* Do not include patch set-specific comments.

Details for each point and good commit message examples can be found on https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Information_in_commit_messages

### References in commit messages
If the commit refers to an issue, add this information to the commit message header or body. e.g. the GitHub web platform automatically converts issue ids (e.g. #123) to links referring to the related issue. For issues tracker like Jira there are plugins which also converts Jira tickets, e.g. [Jirafy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jirafy/npldkpkhkmpnfhpmeoahhakbgcldplbj).

In header:
```
[#123] Refer to GitHub issue…
```
```
CAT-123 Refer to Jira ticket with project identifier CAT…
```
In body:
```
…
Fixes #123, #124
```
